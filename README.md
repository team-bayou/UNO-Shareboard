# UNO-Shareboard
A web application created by Team Bayou in UNO's Spring 2017 Software Engineering course.

The project is divided in a [Frontend](https://github.com/team-bayou/UNO-Shareboard-WebApp) and [Backend](https://github.com/team-bayou/UNO-Shareboard).

Note: For demo app, app response may take a moment due to the server awaking from sleep mode. This is due to using Heroku's free hosting which sleeps when traffic is slow to save computation hours.
A demo app is available [here](https://uno-shareboard-webapp-staging.herokuapp.com/).  
The main wiki can be found [here](https://github.com/team-bayou/UNO-Shareboard/wiki).

Our Waffle board for the backend development can be found [here](https://waffle.io/team-bayou/UNO-Shareboard).
